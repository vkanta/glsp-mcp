# ðŸ›  Tasklist MCP Client

This Rust client connects to an MCP-compatible server via JSON-RPC to:

- Create a new diagram
- Add task nodes
- Connect them with transitions (edges)

It works with the [WASM Component Designer](https://github.com/eclipse-glsp/glsp-mcp) or any GLSP-based frontend that supports MCP.
